PirObject.pm Installation Manual
================================

This distribution consists of very few files:

    lib/PirObject.pm             # The main code file.
    PirModels/TEMPLATE.pir       # A sample object definition file.
    docs/PirObjectManual.txt     # The programming guide for PirObject.pm
    docs/INSTALLATION.txt        # What you are reading right now.
    docs/GPL_LICENSE.txt         # Text of the GPL license that governs this distribution.

    examples/README.txt          # A short text about running the examples.
    examples/intro1.pl           # The first example in the PirObjectManual.
    examples/intro2.pl           # The second example in the manual.
    examples/get_characters.pl   # A new example.
    examples/intro2Internal.pl   # Variation on second example: uses no external .pir files.
    examples/Book.pir            # An object definition file used by the examples.
    examples/Character.pir       # Another object definition file.

Installation is straightforward:

1- Place PirObject.pm in a directory accessible by your PERL5LIB
   search path. It can be a subdirectory of the user's home directory
   or more generally one of the directories specified by perl's
   @INC array. A way to check which directories your perl executable
   will search is to type "perl -V" and to have a look at the content
   of @INC. You can add directories to this list by setting your
   PERL5LIB environment variable (or simply PERLLIB in certain
   cases, be careful). See the "perlrun" man page for more information.

2- Create a directory somewhere where you will keep short text files
   called "object definition files". We suggest you call this
   directory "PirModels". The files in PirModels have a ".pir"
   extension. At first, just keep a read-only copy of TEMPLATE.pir,
   you will use this file to create your own ".pir" files later on.

3- (OPTIONAL) You can edit PirObject.pm to add one or many site-specific
   custom search directories for the object definition files; the
   array to edit is near the top and is called @DATAMODEL_PATH.  So
   this is the array where you can specify the path of the directory
   you created in step 2 above. This is the only 'configuration'
   step that can be performed, and it's optional (search directories
   can be modified at run time by the applications themselves, so
   performing this step is not necessary).

This is it. Perl applications and programs should now be able to
load the module with the line

   "use PirObject;"

at their top. Programmers who intend to to use the module should
now read AT LEAST the section called "Introduction" of the
PirObjectManual, and the section "PirObject Methods". To run the
sample examples, you can go to the examples subdirectory and follow
the instructions in the file README.txt.
