## PirObject: a Perl data model library

This is Perl library, PirObject.pm, which provides
a simple way to model data objects.

The full documentation can be found in a plain text
file inside the repository, in [docs/PirObjectManual.txt](https://github.com/prioux/PirObject/blob/master/docs/PirObjectManual.txt).

There is little need for such a library in the modern
programming world, it is here mostly as service to
historical systems built using it.

#### History

This is a complete re-implementation of a software module called
"PomObject.pm" that was originally written and used internally at
Incyte Genomics (now Incyte Corporation) from 2000 to 2004. More
history can be found in the documentation file PirObjectManual file.

The original distribution platform for this software was SourceForge;
it can still be found there at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pirobject/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pirobject/) ;
there is even a crummy project page at [http://pirobject.sourceforge.net/](http://pirobject.sourceforge.net/) !
The code was maintained in CVS, but was converted to a GIT repository
thanks to two fine piece of software:

* The excellent utility [cvs2git](http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/cvs2git.html)
* Some of my own bash wrapper scripts for converting CVS to GIT.
